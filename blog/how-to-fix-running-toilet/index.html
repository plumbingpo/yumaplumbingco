        <p>A toilet that will not stop running is one of the most common plumbing problems homeowners face. In Yuma, AZ, a running toilet can waste hundreds of gallons of water every day, driving up your utility bills and putting unnecessary strain on your plumbing system. Yuma Plumbing Co provides service to homeowners throughout Yuma with toilet repairs of all kinds. Here is everything you need to know about diagnosing and repairing a running toilet.</p>
<h2>How Your Toilet Flush Mechanism Works</h2>
<p>Before you can fix a running toilet, it helps to understand how the flush mechanism works. When you press the handle, a chain lifts the flapper valve at the bottom of the tank, allowing water to rush into the bowl. Once the tank empties, the flapper falls back into place and seals the tank. The fill valve then opens to refill the tank with fresh water. A float rises with the water level and shuts off the fill valve when the tank is full. When any of these components malfunction, you end up with a toilet that runs continuously or cycles on and off.</p>
<p>The tank is the upper portion of your toilet that holds the water used for flushing. Inside, you will find the fill valve (also called a ballcock), the flapper, the overflow tube, and the flush handle mechanism with its chain. Each of these parts is inexpensive and relatively easy to replace, which is why running toilet repairs are among the most straightforward plumbing fixes a homeowner can tackle. However, knowing which component is causing the problem is the key to a successful repair.</p>
<h2>Check the Flapper First</h2>
<p>In the vast majority of cases, a running toilet is caused by a worn, warped, or deteriorated flapper valve. The flapper is a rubber or silicone seal that sits over the flush valve opening at the bottom of the tank. Over time, the flapper degrades due to exposure to chlorine and minerals in the water. It can become stiff, warped, or develop mineral deposits that prevent it from sealing properly. When the flapper does not seal, water continuously leaks from the tank into the bowl, and the fill valve keeps running to compensate.</p>
<p>To check the flapper, remove the tank lid and look at the flapper while the toilet is running. Press down gently on the flapper with your finger. If the running stops, you have confirmed the flapper is the problem. You can also add a few drops of food coloring to the tank water and wait 15 minutes without flushing. If colored water appears in the bowl, the flapper is leaking.</p>
<p>Replacing a flapper is a simple DIY job. Turn off the water supply valve behind the toilet, flush to empty the tank, unhook the old flapper from the overflow tube ears, disconnect the chain from the flush lever, and snap the new flapper into place. Reconnect the chain, turn the water back on, and test. New flappers cost two to five dollars at any hardware store. Make sure to bring the old flapper with you to match the size and style, as there are several different types.</p>
<p>Something to keep in mind: if you use drop-in tank cleaning tablets that contain chlorine or bleach, they dramatically accelerate flapper deterioration. Many plumbers recommend avoiding these products entirely and using bowl cleaners instead to preserve your flapper and other tank components.</p>

<h2>Adjusting the Fill Valve and Float</h2>
<p>If the flapper is in good condition, the next most likely cause of a running toilet is the fill valve. The fill valve controls the water flowing into the tank after a flush. It uses a float mechanism to sense the water level. When the water reaches the correct level, the float triggers the valve to shut off. If the float is set too high, water rises above the overflow tube and drains continuously into the bowl. If the fill valve itself is worn out, it may not shut off completely regardless of the float position.</p>
<p>Modern toilets use a float cup that slides up and down on the fill valve shaft. You can adjust the water level by turning the adjustment screw on top of the fill valve, usually a quarter turn at a time. The correct water level is typically marked inside the tank or should be about one inch below the top of the overflow tube. If lowering the float does not stop the running, the fill valve may need replacement.</p>
<p>Older toilets may use a ball float on a metal arm. The ball can develop cracks and take on water, making it too heavy to rise fully and shut off the valve. You can try bending the float arm slightly downward to lower the water level, or replace the ball float if it is waterlogged. Better yet, upgrade to a modern fill valve assembly, which is more reliable and easier to adjust. A complete fill valve replacement kit costs ten to fifteen dollars and installs in about twenty minutes.</p>
<h2>Checking the Overflow Tube</h2>
<p>The overflow tube is the large vertical tube in the center of your toilet tank. Its purpose is to prevent the tank from overflowing if the fill valve fails to shut off. Water that rises above the overflow tube drains safely into the bowl rather than flooding your bathroom floor. However, if water is constantly flowing into the overflow tube, it means the fill valve is not shutting off at the correct level.</p>
<p>In some cases, the overflow tube itself can crack or become too short relative to the water level. If the tube is cracked below the waterline, water will leak through the crack into the bowl. A cracked overflow tube typically requires replacing the entire flush valve assembly, which is a more involved repair. While still a DIY-possible project, it requires removing the toilet tank from the bowl to access the flush valve mounting nut underneath.</p>
<p>If you notice the overflow tube is damaged or if adjusting the fill valve does not solve the problem, this is a good time to consider calling a professional plumber. The repair involves working with the tank bolts and wax ring seal, and improper reassembly can lead to leaks.</p>
<h2>The Flush Handle and Chain</h2>
<p>Sometimes a running toilet is caused by something as simple as the chain connecting the flush handle to the flapper. If the chain is too short, it holds the flapper slightly open, allowing water to leak continuously. If it is too long, it can get caught under the flapper and prevent a proper seal. The chain should have about half an inch of slack when the flapper is closed.</p>
<p>The flush handle itself can also cause problems. If the handle sticks in the down position after flushing, it holds the chain taut and keeps the flapper open. A sticking handle is usually caused by mineral buildup on the handle mounting nut or a corroded handle mechanism. Cleaning the mounting area or replacing the handle (an inexpensive and easy fix) typically resolves the issue.</p>
<p>Check that the chain is not tangled or kinked, and make sure it is connected to the correct hole on the flush lever. Most flush levers have multiple holes to allow chain length adjustment. Moving the chain to a different hole is often all that is needed to get the right amount of slack.</p>

<h2>When to Call a Professional Plumber</h2>
<p>Not every running toilet is a simple fix. Here is when you should call a licensed plumber. If you have replaced the flapper and fill valve and the toilet still runs, there may be a problem with the flush valve seat itself. The flush valve seat is the surface the flapper seals against. If it is corroded, pitted, or has mineral deposits, even a new flapper will not seal properly. Resurfacing or replacing the flush valve seat is a more advanced repair.</p>
<p>If your toilet is old, runs constantly despite repairs, or has multiple issues, replacing the entire toilet may be more cost-effective than continuing to repair aging components. Modern low-flow toilets use 1.28 gallons per flush compared to 3.5 to 7 gallons for older models, so a new toilet will save significant water and money over time. A professional plumber can advise whether repair or replacement makes more sense for your situation.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you notice water on the floor around the base of the toilet, a rocking toilet, or sewer odors, these indicate problems beyond a simple running toilet. These issues may involve a failed wax ring seal, loose mounting bolts, or even a cracked toilet base, all of which require professional diagnosis and repair.</p>
<h2>How Much Water Does a Running Toilet Waste?</h2>
<p>A running toilet can waste a staggering amount of water. Depending on the severity of the leak, a running toilet can waste 200 to 2,000 gallons of water per day. At average water rates in Yuma, AZ, that can add fifty to several hundred dollars to a single monthly water bill. Over a year, the wasted water and increased costs far exceed the price of a simple repair.</p>
<p>Beyond the cost, wasting water is an environmental concern, especially in areas where water conservation is important. Fixing a running toilet is one of the easiest and most impactful things you can do to reduce your household water consumption. Many water utilities offer free dye test tablets to help homeowners detect toilet leaks, and some even offer rebates for upgrading to high-efficiency toilets.</p>
